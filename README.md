# LiriBot

(Homework 10 due Saturday 10/5/19)

## What is LiriBot?

LiriBot is a Command Line Interface App that allows users to search for Entertainment information - either movies (via OMDB), music (via Spotify), or search for when a band will be performing (via SeatGeek).

## Getting Started

NPM dependencies:

- axios (for Seatgeek and OMDB)
- node-spotify-api
- moment
- dotenv
- inquirer
- fs

After pulling this folder to your computer -- To use LiriBot, please make sure to load all of your npm packages as listed above. You will also need your own .env file to live in the folder, that will contain your own Spotify API Key and Secret. In the body of the .env file, you will write:

SPOTIFY_ID=your-spotify-id
SPOTIFY_SECRET=your-spotify-secret

(replacing the values after the "=" with your own).

## How to use

1. It's very easy to use LiriBot! Just run the app (node liribot.js) from your command line and follow the prompts.
2. Make your selections by scrolling "up" or "down" with the arrow keys and then hit "return".
3. When prompted, type in your search (no need for quotations or camelCasing)
4. Hit "return" to see the magic happen
5. Repeat as needed!
6. You may also see a log of previous searches in the log.txt file
